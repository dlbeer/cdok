Calcudoku is a sudoku-like game invented by Tetsuya Miyamoto (marketed
under the trademarked name "KenKen"). The following is an example of a
6x6 calcudoku puzzle:

As in sudoku, each row and each column must contain the numbers 1 to 6
once each. Some initial values may be given. There are no sub-boxes,
but groups of connected cells outlined in double-lines contain a clue
in the top-left corner (e.g. "11+"). The clue consists of a target
value and one of the characters +, -, * or /, indicating the type of
the group:

Sum: +

  ~ The numbers in this group must add to the target value.

Difference: -

  ~ One of the numbers in this group, minus the rest, must equal the
    target value (the number to be subtracted from may be any of the
    cells).

Product: *

  ~ The numbers in this group must multiply to produce the target value.

Ratio: /

  ~ One of the numbers in this group, divided by all of the others,
    must equal the target value. As in a difference group, which of
    the cells contains the number to be divided is not specified.

Numbers may be repeated within a group (so long as they're not also
repeated within a row or column). Each puzzle has a unique
solution. The solution to the example shown above is:

This program, cdok, can be used to examine, print, solve and generate
these puzzles. Puzzles are parsed in a "puzzle spec" format, where
rows are given one per line, with cells separated by spaces. Groups
are labelled with alphabetic characters, which are then used to
identify cell membership. A valid puzzle spec for the example above
is:

    J+12    F/4     5       2       E*3     E
    J       F       H+7     H       I*60    I
    J       D+12    G+28    G       G       I
    3       D       K-1     K       G       G
    4       D       D       B+11    G       A*2
    C+10    C       C       B       4       A

Puzzle specs may be terminated by a blank line. Anything following the
blank line is ignored when parsing.

Installation
------------

To build cdok, type ``make``. Type ``make install`` to install the
resulting binary.

Try it out by typing ``cdok generate`` to generate a 6x6 puzzle. If
your terminal supports UTF-8, use the ``-u`` flag to draw the puzzle
using UTF-8 line-drawing characters.

Some definitions of Calcudoku require that difference and ratio groups
be limited to two cells (to avoid confusion due to the
non-associativity of subtraction and division). Cdok does not impose
this requirement in generated puzzles by default, but it will if you
use the ``-T`` option.

Type ``cdok --help`` to get a full list of options.
